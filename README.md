## Overview
**Logtracing** is a suite that allows you to track errors that occur in your applications. It also allows you to have full control of how and where to store all the collected information, this means that you need to have your own database where all the information will be stored.

Also, **Logtracing** provides a dashboard to monitoring your errors, but you can use or create your own monitoring dashboard.

Right now is available for the following tech stacks:
- JavaScript (NodeJS)
- Python (In Progress)

**What information does this suite track?**
- Error Stack
- Code lines of each function
- Environment variables
- SO Information

## :wrench: Configuration

### :open_file_folder: Creating your database
Before start using this suite, you need to have a MySQL database ready to be used (locally or in a server) and create the required tables.

You can find the migration SQL file here: [SQL for tables](https://github.com/logtracing/node-pkg/blob/main/database.sql)

### :rocket: Usage
Install the package:
```bash
npm i @logtracing/node
```

Create a `.env` file and add the following properties with your own information, replace `[ENV]` with your environment (`DEV`, `TEST`, or `PROD`):
```properties
MYSQL_USERNAME_[ENV]=
MYSQL_PASSWORD_[ENV]=
MYSQL_DATABASE_[ENV]=
MYSQL_HOST_[ENV]=
MYSQL_PORT_[ENV]=
```

Load your `.env` file using the [dotenv module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) at the very beginning of your code (before other code runs):
```js
require('dotenv').config();

// or

import 'dotenv/config';
```

Import it in your code:
```js
const { Logger } = require('@logtracing/node');

// or

import { Logger } from '@logtracing/node';
```

Start tracking your errors:
```js
// Create an instance of Logger with the name or your current flow
const log = new Logger('Example flow');

const user = {
  username: 'admin',
  email: 'email@admin.com'
};

const foo = (): void => {
  throw new Error('Foo Error');
};

const bar = (): void => {
  foo();
};

// You can add extra information that could be useful to understand the error
log.addExtra('User information', {
  user: user,
});

try {
  bar();
} catch (err) {
  log.addExtra('More information', 'Handled Error Message');

  // Start to track the error
  log.trackError(err).then(() => {
  
    // When finish, call report() to send all the information to your DB
    log.report();
  });
}
```

:zap: **After doing this, you'll have in your configured database all the information related to the error that you tracked.**

## :arrow_down: Installation for development purposes
### Configuring MySQL
This project uses `mysql` as a database provider, so it is important to have a database before start making changes.

We have a `docker-compose.yml` file that provides you with a database ready to use, you just need to execute:
```bash
docker compose up
```

Then, when the container is up, you can execute the migrations by running:
```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

### Getting the code
Clone this project:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:logtracing/node-pkg.git

# I recommend you change the name of the folder in your machine
git clone git@github.com:logtracing/node-pkg.git logtracing-nodejs
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
cd logtracing-nodejs && npm install
```

Create a `.env` file and fill it with the missing information:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Transpile TS files into JS files:
```bash
npm run build
```

Run the tests:
```bash
npm run test
```
